            Hi, my name is Gabrielle Burke, and I am a finalising Computer Science student at the University of the West Indies.
            My interests include technology and its application in medicine, volunteering, doing personal charity projects, and sports.
            I am interested in Web Development because I view it as a creative outlet for communicating information, needs, and services.
            I also think the process can be fun.
